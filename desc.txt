Launch files are scripts that allow you to start multiple executables simultaneously. These executables can be:
  Within the same C++ package
  In different C++ packages
  Across multiple packages, launching different executables from entirely separate packages
Launch files help streamline the execution of complex ROS 2 systems, making it easier to manage multiple nodes and processes efficiently.


To use launch files with C++ packages, we need the following:
  A launch folder inside the ROS2 package.
  A launch file inside the launch folder.
  Ensure the launch folder is included in the CMakeLists.txt so it can be found.
The goal is to create a launch file that can start TWO C++ executables at the same time for two different robots.
