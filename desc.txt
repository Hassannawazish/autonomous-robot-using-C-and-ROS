Launch files are scripts that allow you to start multiple executables simultaneously. These executables can be:
  Within the same C++ package
  In different C++ packages
  Across multiple packages, launching different executables from entirely separate packages
Launch files help streamline the execution of complex ROS 2 systems, making it easier to manage multiple nodes and processes efficiently.
